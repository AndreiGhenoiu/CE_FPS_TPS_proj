The contents of this repository will go into your project Code directory.

Once there, you can regenerate the solution for the new code to be loaded into Visual Studio.

Some of the details in the code (paths, etc.) will need to be changed based on your own directory/paths setup.
Examples of these paths would include animation paths, character files path(.cdf files) and geometry paths.
